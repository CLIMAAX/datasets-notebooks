The Jupyter notebook "Heatwave Vulnerability Index Guide.ipybn" 
is set to run without any manual changes to the directory's paths. 
The code has to be run from the directory where input folder is
located as well, just like in the repository structure.
Nothing in the structure should be changed for the code to run properly.

The necessary set up:

1. First  Install anaconda to run the Jupyter notebook from: 
https://www.anaconda.com

	1.1. Create the suitable environment in anaconda prompt:
	conda create -n hvi_env python=3.9 numpy geopandas rasterio rioxarray rasterstats fiona shapely pyproj folium matplotlib pandas -c conda-forge

	1.2. Activate the environment by typing in the prompt:
	conda activate hvi_env

	1.3. Install Jupyter Lab by typing in the prompt:
	conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab

	1.4. Open Jupyter Lab by typing in the prompt:
	jupyter lab

	1.5. Find the folder where you located 
	the "Heatwave Vulnerability Index Guide.ipybn" and start analysis.
	


2. During analysis in R you will be asked to use 
the PCA_Calculator_for_Heatwave_SoVI.Rmd.
The code is set to run in the Rstudio.
